# USERS APP - how to run it

This project is an API App written in .NET 7. To run it just use this command in the API subfolder:
```bash
  dotnet run
```

Then go to you local [Swagger](https://localhost:6001/swagger/index.html) and try the API by yourself.

You can also go to the second repository which is a [Client written in Angular](https://github.com/bursztynsky/UsersApp.API)
